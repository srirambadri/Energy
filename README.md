# Energy Consumption Forecasting
- The ability to efficiently forecast hourly energy consumption plays an important role on how energy is distributed and consumed. - London Energy Dataset (London Datastore) which contains the energy consumption of 5,567 randomly selected households in the city of London, UK for the time period of November 2011 to February 2014.
- Additional weather related data to improve prediction (ECA dataset)
- Using Ensemble models: extreme gradient boosting or XGBoost and light gradient boosting or LGB models

# Forecasting with Deep learning
- Deep learning algorithms have played vital roles in prediction and forecasting problems 
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long-Term Short Memory (LSTM) are applied with the aim of making forecast on future energy consumption
- Models generally performed better by reducing batch size and by increasing epoch sizes. Results are evaluated using RMSE, MAE and R2 scores

# Energy Trading  
- Developed an algorithm to maximize profits from trades between two auctions of the day-ahead market in UK's electricity market(Kaggle)
